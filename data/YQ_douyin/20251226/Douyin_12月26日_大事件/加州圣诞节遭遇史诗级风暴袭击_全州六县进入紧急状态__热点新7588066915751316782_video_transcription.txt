Over the last 24 hours, some parts of Southern California have broken daily rainfall records that they haven't seen in more than 50 years. The ground is so saturated it doesn't take much rain to send mud racing down the burned foothills here in Altadena, and now this region is bracing for round two. From the hills of Altadena to flooded freeways, California remains waterlogged. People drive around road closed signs and they think they can drive through the water, and what happens, they end up getting stuck, flood out their engine, and then we have to come save them. And it keeps on coming, creating Christmas havoc. Hardest hit, the mountain community of Wrightwood, where 10 inches of rain poured onto burn scar hillsides, sending water and mud straight into town. Eric Sherwin is with San Bernardino County Fire. Water rescues from vehicles traveling onto flooded roadways.
We had people that were trapped in their houses. Wrightwood resident Tim Needham took this video of a dramatic rescue from a rooftop. We walked as far as we could without getting swept up in the water and saw that there were people that my neighbors were on top of their roof. At least three people have been killed since the storm began, including a man in San Diego who was crushed by a falling tree. In the Sierra, snow snarled traffic on a major highway, Interstate 80. But in California ski resorts, at least 3 ft of new snow was a welcome treat, unless you were the one shoveling. And a flood watch warning is in effect through tomorrow afternoon, not just here, but in Northern California where weather conditions has prompted Waymo to temporarily suspend service major.
