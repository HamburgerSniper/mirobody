How you look at something if your name's attached to it, that you do it right, the best of your ability every single time. Championships aren't won in the theater of the arena. They're won in the thousands of hours in the training room, in the labs, in the 5 a. M. Runs, when it's raining, when everyone else is sleeping. That's when it's won. The heart of a champion is a light switch that's always on. It doesn't go on and off when someone's watching. It's constant. Fear is self-imposed. Meaning it doesn't exist. You create it, you can destroy it too. I love fear. Reason why? Behind every fear is a person you want to be. You face your fears, you become the person you want to be. You run from your fears, you're not living. You're alive, but you're not digging into freedom. If you face your fears, guys, that fear is destroyed. It comes back and it's confidence. What else am I capable of?
